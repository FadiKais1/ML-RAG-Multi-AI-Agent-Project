# ML RAG Multi-Agent Project

A dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to continuously
update its knowledge base using new research papers. The project includes:

- End-to-end RAG pipeline (loader → chunker → embeddings → vector DB → LLM)
- Automatic Updating Agent that detects new documents and updates embeddings
- Evaluation tools to measure retrieval & generation quality
- Modular architecture built with Python & LangChain
